What a thing to do, letting love slip through your fingers, the thing is, it might not ever happen again, or the one you let go just might have been the only one for you, so be careful, don't let it happen to you, trust me, butter is hard to get off your hands, but the love you lost will be nearly impossible to get out of your heart, I know! Enjoy, Dave :)
