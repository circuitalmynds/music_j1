00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.760
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.560
South of the river, you stop
and you hold everything

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.600
A band is blowing Dixie,
double-four time

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.600
You feel alright when
you hear the music ring

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.360
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Coming in out of the rain
to hear the Jazz go down

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240
Competition in other places

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.800
Ah, but the horns,
they blowin' that sound

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.920
Way on down south

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.160
Way on down south, London town

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.240
Check out guitar George

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.360
He knows all the chords

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.520
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.040
Yes and an old guitar is
all he can afford

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.960
When he gets up under
the lights to play his thing

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.360
And Harry doesn't mind
if he doesn't make the scene

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.440
He's got a daytime job,
he's doing alright

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.040
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.120
Saving it up for Friday night

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
With the Sultans

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.200
With the Sultans of Swing

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.000
And then the man,
he steps right up to the microphone

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.440
And says at last, 
just as the time bell rings

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.320
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.200
Then he makes it fast
with one more thing

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
"We are the Sultans

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.040
We are the Sultans of Swing"
